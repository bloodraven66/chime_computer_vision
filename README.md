`computer_vision_project` has the initial codebase for all fully new implementations for training a simple AV-ASR system.

`train.sh` and `sge.sh` runs the training and inference jobs.

`script/train.py` and `script/inference.py` and `src/dataset/avhubert_dataset.py` are the modified scripts handling different data augmentations and input modification.
